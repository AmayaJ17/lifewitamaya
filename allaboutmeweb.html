  <p>Hi my name is Amaya Johnson and ima tell you a little about me
   I'm am class of 2019 I attend Lawndale High School, at Lawndale I run track
   and its going to be my 3rd year. When I was little I enjoyed art I even
considered going to school for art and being an artist but I grew older and didnt
want to be an artist, but I still love art I draw on my free time I took a couple
classes and then I stopped. I practice hair just for fun and so I know if I
can do myself then I will, I dont have to wait for someone to do my hair or pay
extra money. When I was about five I wanted to be a chef/artist/hairstyle but
I got like to age 15 and just was like I dont wanna cook and I cant cook so I yeah
that wasn't for me, hair I still do it but I only do my hair to keep it up,
art is just a hobby. As me being 17 I relly wanna do alot, im working on getting
a clothing line so it can expand. When I get older like 22 ,I wanna get my fisrt
place have my fisrt bussiness and let it expand from there, start young and finsh big!
Im coming from a famliy where mom and dad dont get along and i have about 5 siblings
maybe 6 but yeah im the oldest and im really spoiled but i act like im broke and I
 dont got money knowing I can get money but I wanna get that money on own.</p>
